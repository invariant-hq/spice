(* Blackbox pty tests for the [spice tui-next] model + effort panel
   (doc/ui-design/05-overlays-pickers.md §Model picker in the 03-ia panel shell;
   phase 5 of doc/plans/tui-next-surfaces.md §Sequencing). The panel runs no
   turns — it reads the pure catalog and writes the user config — so there is no
   fake provider: the tests drive [/model] (and the settings model row) on the
   real binary and golden the rendered panel.

   The env authenticates OpenAI ([OPENAI_API_KEY]) so the configured
   [openai/gpt-5.5] renders as a normal, current row with its [✓] and a live
   effort line, while Anthropic/Google/DeepSeek stay locked — the mute-and-show
   rows the panel draws with [log in to use]. Goldens pin SPICE_REDUCED_MOTION=1
   for a static lockup and the readable 80x24 the spec mockups use. Config writes
   land in the user config under the isolated XDG home; the select test reads it
   back. Enter is always sent as a SEPARATE write from the command text (the
   atomic-enter pty artifact). *)
